                <p>During the first phase of the ideation, Pocholo and I first had to come up with a brand and brand identity. Through exploring a multitude of different themes and ideas, we settled upon a pizza company that utilized neon and retro aesthetics. 

                    As a part of the initial phase, Pocholo and I set up GitKraken to better sort our individual local branches from the main branch. We started first by designing a style guide in order to ensure that our website had consistent elements throughout.

                <P>The biggest challenges that Pocholo and I faced were creating a new company to design for. We were both well versed in creating solutions, but building a brand was an unfamiliar territory for us. Another challenge we faced was providing users with proper feedback on their interactions, specifically on the checkout pages. </P>

            <div class="four-item">
                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <p>The solution we found for our lack of experience designing a new company was to explore different company websites. We wanted to find inspiration from existing websites in order to help guide our project. In the end, we discovered that we wanted to design in the domain of food, specifically highly customizable food like pizza. 
                    <br><br>
                    Providing feedback on interactions was challenging, especially due to only using HTML and CSS. We experimented with different CSS animations to try to find the correct interaction for our purposes. However, CSS and its limitations did not allow us to fully solve our issues, so instead, Pocholo began looking at Javascript popups. Javascript ended up being the exact tool we needed for the interaction we had in mind.

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>Through working on this project, I had my initial experience working with Git through GitKraken. The use of Git allowed me to further develop my collaborative work. Learning version control was pivotal in my development as a web developer, as it allowed me to store multiple branches in order to minimize losing my work. </p>

                <p>The brand building design allowed me to further develop my good habits for collaborative work. The introduction of Git in this project, as well as using a style guide kept me on track and consistent throughout my work. This allowed Pocholo and I to be able to complete our work knowing that the website will be consistent through and through. Through tackling our challenges, we were able to develop our research and observation skills, as well as develop a foundation in Javascript for future projects. </p>
