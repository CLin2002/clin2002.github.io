            <p>The personal portfolio project was an opportunity for me to further develop my skills in web development, as well as a chance for me to highlight my experience. In this project, I was able to further develop my skills in Javascript. Taking precedent from my experience, I started by creating a style guide and used Git to ensure that I had full control over my version history.

                <h2>Initial Phase</h2>
                <p>I began my personal portfolio project by first setting up a GitHub repository in order to have full control over my version history. After successfully setting up my repository, I began by designing my own design decisions. These decisions included the choice of colour, exploring different layouts, as well as styling elements to fit my personal style. From my style guide, I added all the required and relevant pages. The pages I included were an about me, project, as well as a contact page. 
                    <br><br>
                    As I began to think more about how I wanted to best represent myself on my portfolio, I first thought about the most relevant projects to highlight my skills. In addition, I laid out all the information relevant to each project to allow the reader to best understand my processes.

                <h2>Second Phase</h2>
                <p>After laying and considering my website flow, I started to build my website, exploring flexboxes in order to maintain responsiveness. I used a one column grid to help users better navigate large amounts of text. 
                    <br><br>
                    Using my basic skeleton with all my text included, I started furnishing my website. I wanted to make sure that viewers could see my other projects without being required to re-navigate back to my project page. Based on this goal, I added a carousel on the bottom of the page that listed my other projects.

                <h2>Final Phase</h2>
                <p>Other considerations I made to my website was to embed a video, as well as add animations to make my website feel more personalized. Using CSS animations, i settled on some animations that I liked, but felt that my options were limited by the capabilities of CSS. This is where I started exploring Javascript in more detail. Using Javascript, I tracked scrollwheel in order to perform specific animations as the viewer scrolls through my page. </p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <P>Some challenges I faced while working on this project was working with Javascript. Because Javascript was an unfamailiar tool to me, I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to properly use it. Other challenges I faced were issues with embedding videos properly without breaking the aspect ratio.

            <div class="four-item">
                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <p>The solution to not understanding the nuances of Javascript was to learn more about Javascript. In addition to learning more about Javascript, I also applied my Java and Python knowledge in order to find similarities and inspirations I could use to combat my lack of knowledge of Javascript. 

                    <br><br>
                    Embedding videos was difficult because they would show up as different sizes and aspect ratios on different screen sizes. I was able to combat this issue by simply using the embedding link provided by video sharing services such as YouTube.

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>The main takeaway I had from this project was that, although linear grids can be easier to read, they don’t allow for a lot of customizability, and can fall rather flat. If I had the chance to add changes to my project, I would test a variety of different grids in order to create visual interest. There were also some sizing issues with the embedded videos that I was unable to solve given the duration of the project. </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>The personal portfolio project allowed me to further explore Javascript and Git. I learned about the limitations of Git, including how it has a limited upload capacity. Instilling good collaborative work practics on an individual project was one of my main priorities. Exploring Javascript allowed me to further enhance and express my creative freedom. This project developed my skills not only in Javascript, but also allowed me to practice good HTML and CSS procedures. Being able to highlight my skills within a project I have created myself was a rewarding and fun objective. </p>
